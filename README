Code to operate on xyz style configurations; the currently support operations are:
1. Compare one or many configurations with respect a reference (the first read) configuration;
   The RMSD is computed by:
         rmsd = \sqrt(\sum_{i=1}^N (r_i - r_i^{ref})^2/N)
   The lattices are rotated/translate to match with each other as much as possible.

2. Compute symmetry related info of the input configurations, including:
   1) Symmetry operations;
   2) International lattice group symbol and number;
   3) Schoenflies symbol and number;
   4) Refine the crystal cell, assign Wyckoff positions;
   5) Find the primitive cell;
   6) Find irreducible k-points in the corresponding reciprocal space.


spglib 1.0.3 is needed to evaluate the symmtry related info.
